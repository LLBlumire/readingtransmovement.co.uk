## Toilets

Toilets are often a problem for the trans community, whether out of fear of
being the victim of a hate crime, or not feeling that either traditionally
presented toilet option aligns with their identity.

Often, we are forced to use disabled toilets for our safety, but many of these
are restricted behind radar keys. The following locations have a gender neutral
toilet.

- 7 Flowers & Tea, Cross Street (Next to M&S), RG1 1SN. Gender neutral toilet in
  basement for customers (cheapest menu item Harrogate Spring Water Â£2.65)
- Oracle Shopping Center (Riverside Entrance), RG1 2AG. One disabled toilet is
  radar key restricted, the rest are not.

We are currently collecting the locations of other gender neutral toilets to add
to this list.

## Healthcare

We are currently working on compiling a list of GPs and medical practices in the
local area that are trans friendly and will support shared care plans and DIY
treatment monitoring.
